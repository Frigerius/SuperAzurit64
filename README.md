# SuperAzurit64
SuperAzurit64 is a Platformer with enemies attacking you while trying to reach the end of a level. It's first version was created by some students and me. Afterwards I used it as base for my bachelor thesis and added the AIs.

It was tested with Unity 2017.1.1f1

Controlls:

* A – walk left
* D – walk right
* Space – Jump
* Mouse – target
* Left mouse button – shoot

The game has two levels. The goal is to reach the flag at the end of the level. You can get extra points by collecting crystals and kill the enemy AIs.

The game supports multiple AIs at once, the count can be set in the games Settings. The player also can change the AIs Settings, like its max HP or its weapon accuracy.
